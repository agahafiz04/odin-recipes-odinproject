        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
            <li>½ cup fine dry bread crumbs</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate.</li>
            <li>Whisk together egg, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl.</li>
